It's commonly planted in gardens as a decorative shrub for it's vivid and glossy evergreen foliage, attractive twisting stems, and clusters of white bell-shaped flowers which develop into a bounty of fleshy round red fruits[0] 1-3cm in diameter. It succeeds in poor, even rocky, soils[1] and is well adapted to dry summer conditions[0]. Traditinally prized as a wood for charcoal production[1] and as a fruit for liquers and preserves[2].",

The hermaphrodite flowers are creamy white to pale pink, bell-shaped, 4–6 mm diameter, and produced in panicles of 10–30 together in autumn. The fruit is a fleshy red berry, 1–2 cm diameter, with a rough surface.",

Succeeds in fairly exposed maritime positions[21][15]. Tolerates industrial pollution[15]. Plants have withstood temperatures down to -16°c without injury at Kew[20]. They grow very well in S.W. England, fruiting well in Cornwall[22][23]. Plants resent root disturbance and are best placed in their final positions whilst young[20][18]. Give them some protection in their first winter. \nThere are a number of named varieties[24] developed for their ornamental value. 'Elfin King', 'Croomei' and 'Rubra' are all small forms that fruit well when small[25]. The variety 'Rubra' was 1.2 metres tall at Kew in late 1990 and was laden down with fruits and flowers[K]. 'Elfin King' only reaches a height of 1 metre, comes into bearing when young and fruits well[24]. It is ideal for container culture[24]. 'Croomei' is said to be a more reliable fruiting form[22]."
